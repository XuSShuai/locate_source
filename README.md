# locate_source

## About

Locating source based on sparesly placed observers and utilizes the correlated information between network structure 
(shortest path) and diffusion dynamic(time sequence of infection) on complex network.

## Version

Implemented by python3.

## Introduction

 - Main
   - type:
      ```python
      python locate_source.py 
      ```
      to run source locating algorithm on artifical network("ba" or "er") and have a look the on the output.

   - `base_expriment_code.py` test the average accuracy of algorithm under different percentage of observers on "BA" network and "ER" network, respectively.
